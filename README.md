Highly Experimental Project to bring OpenCL to GNURadio

I've only posted this for collaboration, it's absolutely not ready for use.

Requires clFFT:
apt-get install libclfft-dev
or:
git clone https://github.com/clMathLibraries/clFFT.git
If you get an error finding the libraries running test-clenabled, the libraries you may need to create links to them.
They install by default into /usr/local/lib64/.
