# NVIDIA OpenCL on Ubuntu Notes

The easiest way to get up and running on Ubuntu is to take these steps:


## Setting up NVIDIA driver

### Adding the driver repo

sudo add-apt-repository ppa:graphics-drivers/ppa

sudo apt update

### Finding the latest driver

apt search nvidia-*

You should find a number of them coming back as nvidia-<###>.  When I put these instructions together, 381 looked like the latest, so I installed that like this:

sudo apt install nvidia-381

Once this is done, reboot and make sure your system/display work.  If all is well then continue on.


## Installing OpenCL Dev Files

This is a 3-step process.  First install the repo opencl dev packages and headers:

sudo apt install nvidia-opencl-dev nvidia-cuda-dev

Now go over to NVIDIA and download their Cuda Toolkit:
https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads

For me I selected Linux - x86_64 - Ubuntu - 16.04 - runfile (local).

Once that downloads, install it.  If you take the defaults, it'll put the headers in /usr/local/cuda-8.0/include/CL/

If they're there, run this:
ln -s /usr/local/cuda-8.0/include/CL/cl.hpp /usr/include/CL/cl.hpp

## Installing gr-clenabled

Now that the build environment is all set up you should be all set.  You can either use pybombs or git clone it from github.

### pybombs
pybombs install gr-clenabled

### git

cd /tmp   (or wherever you'd like it)

https://github.com/ghostop14/gr-clenabled.git gr-clenabled

cd gr-clenabled

mkdir build

cd build

cmake ..

make

Install Note: If you installed gnuradio from pybombs and have the environment variables set up okay you shouldn't need to 'sudo make install', just 'make install' should work.  However if you installed gnuradio from the repo (although not recommended) or another way, you may need to 'sudo make install'

make install

ldconfig

DONE!  Fire up gnuradio and enjoy.
